# Mycology Cultivation Protocols Library

This is a community-driven collection of standardized documentation for mushroom cultivation techniques. This repository aims to provide reproducible, safe, and well-documented protocols that protects the accumulated knowledge of mushroom cultivation sources and provides a simple, indexable medium for growing as a mushroom cultivator.

## Project Overview

The library is a work in progress, by and for mycology enthusiasts, researchers, and practitioners. Each protocol in this collection undergoes rigorous review to ensure standardization, safety, and reproducibility. Our documentation will cover various aspects of mushroom cultivation, from basic techniques to advanced procedures. Every aspect of this project is driven by the community, any changes are welcomed in the issues tab of the repo.

## Key Features

- Standardized documentation format for all protocols
- Comprehensive safety guidelines
- Detailed growth parameters for various species
- Quality-focused review process
- Version-controlled protocol management
- Community-driven improvements and updates

## Getting Started

### Using the Protocols

1. Browse the `protocols/` directory for specific techniques
2. Review the `general-information/` section for best practices
3. Each protocol includes:
   - Complete materials list
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Safety requirements
   - Quality indicators
   - Troubleshooting guidance

### Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. Before contributing:

1. Review our [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide
2. Familiarize yourself with our [protocol template](/templates/protocol-template/protocol-name[tag].md)
3. Submit your protocol through our peer review process

## Safety First

Safety is a top priority. All protocols must include the following saftey information:

- Comprehensive risk assessments
- Required safety equipment specifications
- Proper containment procedures
- Emergency response protocols
- Disposal requirements

You don't have to make this yourself! Feel free to link others' saftey practices from within the library!

## Quality Standards

Our protocols maintain high quality through:

- Verified reproduction requirements
- Documented success indicators
- Complete growth parameters
- Thorough review process
- Regular updates and maintenance

## Community Guidelines

- Maintain professional and respectful communication
- Focus on technical accuracy and safety
- Provide constructive feedback
- Document all discussions and decisions
- Help review and improve existing protocols

## Getting Help

- Create an issue for questions or concerns
- Contact repository maintainers
- Review existing protocols for guidance
