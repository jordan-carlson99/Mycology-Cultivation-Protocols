## Safety Information

[Follow general saftey practices](/general-information/saftey/general-safety.md)

### Containment Requirements

- Room with controlled air flow
- No direct fan exposure
- Elevated positioning for proper air circulation

## Required Materials

### Essential Materials

- Clear/transparent tote
- Perlite
- 1/4" drill bit or tool for making holes
- Half-pint wide-mouth jars (for elevation) or PVC for stand
- Spray bottle for misting

## Protocol

### Step 1: Chamber Construction

**Trigger/Timing:** Initial setup

#### Procedure:

1. Create 1/4" holes on all 6 sides of clear tote
2. Space holes approximately 2" apart in grid pattern
3. Include holes on top, bottom, and all vertical sides
4. Construct stand to elevate chamber minimum 2 inches
5. Ensure chamber has 4-5 inches space for perlite plus 5-10 inches head space

**Quality Indicators:**

- Complete hole coverage on all sides
- Proper 2" spacing between holes
- Adequate elevation from surface

**Control Points:**

- Proper hole size (1/4")
- Even hole distribution
- Sufficient chamber elevation

### Step 2: Perlite Preparation

**Trigger/Timing:** After chamber construction

#### Procedure:

1. Rinse perlite multiple times to remove dust
2. Add 4-5 inches of damp perlite to chamber bottom
3. Ensure even distribution

**Quality Indicators:**

- Clean, dust-free perlite
- Proper depth (4-5 inches)
- Even distribution

**Control Points:**

- Thorough perlite rinsing
- Correct moisture level
- Proper depth maintenance

### Step 3: Operation and Maintenance

**Trigger/Timing:** During fruiting

#### Procedure:

1. Mist contents until they glisten with moisture
2. Monitor surface moisture
3. Remist when surface no longer glistens but still appears moist
4. Mist 3-6 times daily as needed
5. Optional fanning after misting only

**Growth Parameters:**

- Misting Frequency: 3-6 times daily
- Air Flow: Natural convection, no direct fans

**Quality Indicators:**

- Proper surface moisture (glistening)
- Absence of wall condensation
- Natural air flow maintained

**Control Points:**

- Regular misting schedule
- Proper humidity maintenance
- Adequate fresh air exchange

## Community Notes

- Effective misting technique: Spray diagonally from corner to corner for even coverage
- Perlite should be "recharged" (rewetted) approximately every 7 days
- Chamber works best when filled to 40-60% capacity with cakes/substrates
- Can be used for both cakes and small bulk substrate trays, though effectiveness may vary
- Hygrometers are generally not reliable for monitoring conditions; visual inspection is preferred
- Natural light supplemented with 6500K LED lighting on 12/12 cycle is sufficient
- Multiple successful grows have been reported with various species using this design
- The design prioritizes passive air exchange - avoid using fans in the room
- For extended absence periods (>24 hours), chamber may dry out without maintenance

- Condensation on walls indicates improper FAE, not proper humidity
- Really large totes may cause uneven drying
- Really small totes may not create proper circulation
- Fanning effectiveness is debated in community
