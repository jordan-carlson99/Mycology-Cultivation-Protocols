- 4 oz or 8 oz mason jars
- Hammer and nail
- Pressure cooker or steamer
- Still Air Box (SAB)
- Fruiting chamber (Water tub or SGFC - Shotgun Fruiting Chamber)

## Protocol

### Step 1: Jar Preparation

**Trigger/Timing:** Initial setup

#### Procedure:

1. Create holes in jar lids:

   - Use hammer and nail to make 2-4 holes in each jar lid  
     <img src="./assets/images/holes in jar lid.jpg" alt="nail and lid">
   - Space holes evenly around the lid  
     <img src="./assets/images/holes%20in%20jar%20lid%20complete.jpg" alt="holes in lid">

2. Prepare substrate mixture (2:1:1 ratio):

   - Measure 2 parts vermiculite  
     <img src="./assets/images/prep substrate mix.jpg" alt="measure substrate">
   - Add 1 part water and mix thoroughly
   - Add 1 part brown rice flour and mix until uniform
   - Check field capacity by squeezing mixture (only a few drops should come out)

3. Fill jars:
   - Load mixture to the jar's band line without packing  
     <img src="./assets/images/dont fill past band.jpg" alt="jar filled to band">
   - Add dry vermiculite layer on top
   - Level dry layer with finger  
     <img src="./assets/images/level substrate.webp" alt="levelling substrate with finger">
   - Secure lids and cover with foil
   - <img src="./assets/images/foiled lid.jpg" alt="lid with foil">

**Quality Indicators:**

- Proper 2:1:1 ratio of vermiculite:BRF:water
- Field capacity moisture content
  - Over field capacity  
    <img src="./assets/images/over field cap.webp">
  - At field capacity  
    <img src="./assets/images/at field cap.webp">
- Even dry vermiculite layer on top

**Control Points:**

- Proper hole placement in lids
- Correct substrate consistency
- Clean preparation area

### Step 2: Sterilization

**Trigger/Timing:** After jar preparation

#### Procedure:

**For Pressure Cooker Method:**

1. Place trivet or metal rack in pressure cooker  
   <img src="./assets/images/pc lids on bottom.jpg" alt="pouring water into pressure cooker with lids and metal rack">
2. Add water as required by your pressure cooker model
3. Arrange jars on rack above water line  
   <img src="./assets/images/jars in pc.jpg" alt="jars in a pressure cooker">
4. Secure lid and bring to 15 PSI  
   <img src="./assets/images/pc at 15psi.jpg" alt="pressure gauge at 15psi">
5. Cook for 45-60 minutes
6. Allow to cool for minimum 8 hours

**For Steam Method:**

1. Line pot bottom with jar rings  
   <img src="./assets/images/lids in pot.jpg" alt="lids in bottom of pot">
2. Add 1-2 inches of water
3. Place folded tinfoil on rings  
   <img src="./assets/images/tinfoil on rings in pot.jpg" alt="tinfoil over rings on bottom of pot">
4. Arrange jars on tinfoil  
   <img src="./assets/images/jars in pot.jpg" alt="jars in pot">
5. Cover with tight-fitting lid
6. Bring to boil then reduce to simmer
7. Steam for 90-120 minutes  
   <img src="./assets/images/jars steaming.jpg" alt="jars steaming in pot">
8. Cool overnight

**Quality Indicators:**

- Complete sterilization
- No contamination after cooling
- Proper moisture content maintained

**Control Points:**

- Maintain proper pressure/temperature
- Adequate water level
- Proper cooling period (8+ hours)
- Temperature: 15 PSI for pressure cooking
- Time: 45-60 minutes (PC) or 90-120 minutes (steam)

### Step 3: Inoculation

**Trigger/Timing:** After sterilization and cooling

#### Procedure:

1. Prepare SAB (Still air box)
2. Place cooled jars in SAB  
   <img src="./assets/images/SAB with jars.jpg" alt="still air box with jars in it">
3. Flame sterilize syringe needle  
   <img src="./assets/images/alc lamp sterilize.jpg" alt="sterilizing needle with alcohol lamp">
4. Let cool briefly
5. Inject 1-2 drops per hole
   <img src="./assets/images/inoculation.webp" alt="innoculating jar with needle">
   - Angle needle against glass
   - Insert through dry verm layer
6. Remove foil after inoculation
7. Repeat flame sterilization every 2 jars

**Quality Indicators:**

   - Invert jar over sink
   - Tap bottom until cake releases
3. Rinse cake under cold water  
   <img src="./assets/images/rinsing cake.jpg" alt="colonized cake being rinsed">
4. Soak preparation:  
   <img src="./assets/images/dunked cake.jpg" alt="cake soaking in container">
   - Submerge cake in clean water
   - Ensure full submersion
   - Soak for 20-24 hours
5. Roll in vermiculite:  
   <img src="./assets/images/cake rolled in verm.jpg" alt="cake being roled in verm">  
   <img src="./assets/images/vermed cake.jpg" alt="cake full rolled in verm">

   - Press vermiculite firmly onto cake

**Quality Indicators:**

- Clean birth without contamination
- Even vermiculite coating
- Proper hydration

**Control Points:**

- Clean birthing technique
- Complete submersion during soak
- 24-hour water soak
- Even vermiculite coverage

### Step 6: Fruiting

**Trigger/Timing:** After birthing and rolling

#### Procedure:

1. Place cookie rack or glass jars in tub
2. Add 1 inch of water to tub
3. Place cakes on rack  
   <img src="./assets/images/cakes on rack.jpg" alt="cakes on rack in a tub">
4. Close lid fully
5. After 48 hours **trigger fruiting**:  
    <img src="./assets/images/coco coir cake colonized.jpg" alt="colonized cake">
   - Mist gently 2-3 times from 3+ feet above
   - Create small lid openings for FAE by offsetting the lid  
     <img src="./assets/images/offset lid.jpg" alt="container lid that has been offset">
   - Maintain surface moisture with periodic misting

**Quality Indicators:**

- Proper surface moisture (Glistening)

**Control Points:**

- Humidity maintenance
- Proper FAE
