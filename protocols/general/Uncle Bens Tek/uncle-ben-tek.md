- 70% isopropyl alcohol
- Micropore tape
- Scissors
- Lighter or torch
- Face mask
- Gloves
- Hat/hairnet
- Lysol spray

For Bulk Substrate:

- 4-6 quart plastic tubs with lids

- Light source and timer

## Protocol

### Step 1: Preparation

**Trigger/Timing:** Initial setup

**Procedure:**

1. Close all windows and turn off any air movement systems (fans, heaters, AC).
2. Take a thorough shower, paying special attention to hands, arms, and under nails.
3. Put on clean clothes and hair covering.
4. Spray room thoroughly with Lysol and allow to settle.
5. Wipe all work surfaces with 70% isopropyl alcohol.
6. Put on face mask and gloves.

**Growth Parameters:**

- Temperature: Room temperature
- Humidity: Normal room conditions
- Time: 30-60 minutes

**Quality Indicators:**

- Still air environment
- Clean workspace
- Proper PPE worn

**Control Points:**

- No moving air in room
- Personal cleanliness
- Surface sanitation

### Step 2: Inoculation

**Trigger/Timing:** After preparation

**Procedure:**

1. Wipe down all Uncle Ben's bags with isopropyl alcohol.
2. Break up rice through the bag to ensure no clumps remain.
3. Cut a diagonal 1-inch slice off the top corner of the bag.
4. Clean spore syringe with isopropyl alcohol.
5. Flame sterilize needle until glowing red hot.
6. Allow needle to cool.
7. Insert syringe through cut corner and inject 0.5-0.75cc of spore solution.
8. Cover corner cut with micropore tape to create gas exchange vent.
9. Set aside completed bag.
10. Repeat process with remaining bags, flame sterilizing between each bag.

**Growth Parameters:**

- Temperature: Room temperature
- Time: Varies based on number of bags

**Quality Indicators:**

- Sterile technique maintained
- Proper injection amount (0.5-0.75cc per bag)
- Clean micropore tape application

**Control Points:**

- Flame sterilization between bags
- Proper injection technique
- Clean workspace
- ISO sanitation between bags

### Step 3: Colonization

**Trigger/Timing:** After inoculation

**Procedure:**

1. Place inoculated bags in a warm, dark location.
2. Maintain temperature between 75-80°F.
3. Monitor bags daily for contamination.
4. At 20-30% colonization, break up mycelium chunk and shake bag vigorously.
5. Allow bags to recover for 24 hours after breaking and shaking.
6. Continue incubation until 100% colonized.

**Growth Parameters:**

- Temperature: 75-80°F
- Time: 1-2 weeks
- Environment: Dark, stable temperature

**Quality Indicators:**

- White, healthy mycelial growth
- No contamination
- Hardened, compacted rice where colonized

**Control Points:**

- Temperature maintenance
- Contamination monitoring
- Break and shake at 20-30% colonization

### Step 4: Bulk Substrate Preparation

**Trigger/Timing:** After 100% colonization

**Procedure:**

1. Place entire brick of coco coir in 5-gallon bucket.
2. Boil 3/4 gallon of water.
3. Pour boiling water over coir.
4. Break up brick while adding water.
5. Continue adding boiling water until substrate is hydrated.
6. Seal bucket with lid.
7. Let sit until cooled to touch (several hours or overnight).
8. Check field capacity by squeezing substrate - should release few drops of water.

**Growth Parameters:**

- Temperature: Use boiling water
- Time: Several hours to overnight for cooling

**Quality Indicators:**

- Field capacity moisture content
- Even substrate consistency
- Proper pasteurization

**Control Points:**

- Proper hydration
- Complete cooling
- Clean preparation

### Step 5: Spawning to Bulk

**Trigger/Timing:** After substrate preparation

**Procedure:**

1. Add 1-inch layer of field capacity coco coir to monotub.
2. Cut open colonized spawn bag and check for contamination.
3. Break apart colonized rice into small pieces using gloved hands.
4. Mix broken spawn with coco coir thoroughly.
5. Add more substrate as needed to reach 2-4 inches depth.
6. Level and smooth surface.
7. Add 1/8 to 1/4 inch casing layer of coco coir.
8. Smooth casing layer surface.

**Growth Parameters:**

- Substrate depth: 2-4 inches
- Temperature: 72-76°F
- Time: Several days

**Quality Indicators:**

- Even mixing of spawn and substrate
- Level surface
- Proper depth
- Complete casing layer coverage

**Control Points:**

- Thorough mixing
- Even surface
- Proper casing layer application

### Step 6: Fruiting

**Trigger/Timing:** After 75% surface colonization

**Procedure:**

1. Allow substrate to colonize with lid closed until 75% coverage.
2. Once colonized, reduce temperature to 72-76°F.
3. Crack/flip lid to introduce fresh air exchange.
4. Set up lighting on 12/12 cycle.
5. Maintain surface moisture through regular misting.
6. Avoid misting directly on pins once they form.
7. Continue maintaining conditions through harvest.

**Growth Parameters:**

- Temperature: 72-76°F
- Light: 12 hours on/12 off (6500K)
- Humidity: Maintained through misting

**Quality Indicators:**

- Proper surface moisture (tiny droplets)
- Good air exchange
- Even pin formation

**Control Points:**

- Surface moisture maintenance
- Fresh air exchange
- Temperature control
- Light cycle maintenance
