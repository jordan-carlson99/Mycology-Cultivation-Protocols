## Known Risks

### Biological Risks

Mycological work involves potential exposure to various biological materials including spores, mycelium, and potential contaminants. Primary risks include:

- Respiratory exposure to airborne spores during handling and processing
- Skin contact with fungi or contaminated materials
- Cross-contamination between cultures
- Exposure to common contaminants including Trichoderma, Penicillium, and Aspergillus species
- Development of allergic responses with repeated exposure
- Potential colonization of surrounding areas if proper containment is not maintained

### Chemical Risks

Standard mycological procedures require the use of various chemicals that present specific hazards:

- Isopropyl alcohol (70%): Flammable, eye and respiratory irritant
- Hydrogen peroxide (3%): Oxidizer, skin and eye irritant
- Bleach solutions: Respiratory irritant, corrosive
- Cleaning agents: Various hazards depending on composition
- Denatured alcohol: Flammable, skin and eye irritant

## Containment Requirements

### Workspace Configuration

Every mycological workspace must maintain:

- Physical separation from living and food preparation areas
- Non-porous, sanitizable work surfaces
- Adequate ventilation with HEPA filtration where required
- Controlled access to prevent unauthorized entry especially by pets or children
- Distinct clean and dirty work zones
- Proper lighting for detailed inspection
- Temperature and humidity control systems

### Containment Systems

All work must utilize appropriate containment:

- Still Air Box (SAB) or Laminar Flow Hood for sterile procedures
- Sealed cultivation containers with appropriate filtration
- Secondary containment for liquid cultures
- Sealed bags for waste materials
- Lockable storage for cultures and materials

## Safety Equipment

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

Required PPE for mycological work:

- Nitrile gloves
- Clean clothes
- Mask

Recommended PPE:

- N95 or equivalent respiratory protection
- Eye protection (splash-resistant goggles)
- Face shield when handling pressurized equipment
- Closed-toe shoes
- Hair covering
- Clean lab coat or disposable coveralls

### Workspace Safety Equipment

Safety equipment for the workspace:

- Eyewash station or portable eyewash
- First aid kit
- Chemical spill kit
- Fire extinguisher (appropriate for chemical hazards)
- Emergency shower or sink access
- Sanitization supplies
- Proper waste containers

## Emergency Procedures

### Exposure Response

In case of exposure to biological or chemical materials:

1. Remove contaminated PPE immediately
2. Wash affected areas thoroughly with soap and water for at least 15 minutes
3. For eye exposure, flush with eyewash for minimum 15 minutes
4. Seek medical attention if symptoms develop
5. Review and revise safety procedures as needed

### Contamination Response

When contamination is detected:

1. Don fresh PPE before handling
2. Isolate contaminated materials immediately
3. Document type and extent of contamination
4. Seal in minimum three layers of thick plastic
5. Remove from cultivation area
6. Perform thorough decontamination of affected areas
7. Review procedures to identify contamination source
8. Implement preventive measures

## Storage Safety

### Culture Storage Requirements

Proper storage conditions must include:

- Secure, access-controlled location
- Temperature monitoring and control
- Regular contamination checks
- Clear labeling system
- Inventory tracking
- Separate storage for different species
- Regular viability testing

### Material Storage Guidelines

All materials must be stored following these guidelines:

- Chemicals in original containers with intact labels
- Separate storage for incompatible materials
- Temperature and humidity appropriate storage
- Well-ventilated storage areas
- Protection from light when required
- Clear expiration date tracking

## Disposal Requirements

### General Waste Disposal

Standard waste handling procedures:

- Use designated disposal containers
- Follow local regulations for disposal

### Contaminated Material Disposal

Special procedures for contaminated materials:

1. Dispose according to local regulations
2. Document disposal in contamination log
3. Clean and sanitize disposal area

### Chemical Waste Disposal

Proper chemical disposal procedures:

1. Segregate incompatible chemicals
2. Use appropriate chemical waste containers
3. Label with contents and accumulation date
4. Store in designated chemical waste area
5. Arrange disposal through authorized facilities
6. Maintain disposal documentation
7. Follow all applicable regulations
